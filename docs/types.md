## ```u32```
The ```u32``` type is an unsigned 32-bit integer. Postfix integer literals with ```u32```.

## ```i8```
The ```i8``` type is a signed 8-bit integer. It is the default size for integer literals. Postfix integer literals with ```i8```.

## ```u8```
The ```u8``` type is an unsigned 8-bit integer. Postfix integer literals with ```u8```.

## ```unit```

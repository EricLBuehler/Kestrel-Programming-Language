# Function Types

Functions are defined by the [```fn```](fn.md#fn) keyword. There are 2 variants:

- Methods
- Namespace

## Methods
Methods are linked to a struct instance and take a ```self``` argument of the type of the specified struct.

## Namespace functions
Namespace functions are, like methods, connected to structs, but do not take a ```self``` argument.
